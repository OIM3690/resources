## Private Repository for the Course

Your first task in this course is to create your web page for this course. This will be very simple and clean to start with. We will make this more sophisticated as we get deeper into the course and we will link all of the deliverables for the course to this page. This will create your personal web site (private repository). The most important purpose for this web site is to **list and link** all of your class deliverables - in-class deliverables, graded homework, term project and exam (only if specified) - after you commit and push to your private repository. It is critical that you keep this repository updated. The graded work for the class will be graded off of this web page (in other words, I will be accessing your graded homework/exam through the link you have created on this web site).

## Project

The term project is an individual website development effort, which involves the conception, design and implementation of a website. You must publish your site to an advertising-free hosting service. You may use free cloud service or GitHub Pages to host your website. Deliverables are due periodically during the semester, shown in the course schedule. Although we will not have any class presentations of projects, the instructor may ask specific students to present projects based on value it might add to the class. More details will be posted soon.

## Graded Homework

There will be a total of 4-5 homework-assignments that are graded. Each is to be submitted by 11:59 pm on the due dates, which will be specified in the instruction document that accompanies each assignment. **10 points** will be deducted for each day or partial day that an assignment is late up to four days. The grade for any assignment submitted more than four days late will be zero. Extensions may be granted at the discretion of the instructor if requested in advance. Assignments are considered to be **individual** activities. If you require help, please contact the instructor. Notice: Your assignment repositories created under course [GitHub](https://github.com/OIM3690) (not your own private repositories) may be modified/removed by the instructor after semester ends.

## In-Class Exercises

In almost every class we will be completing a few small hands-on exercises (usually labeled as **"ex_"** on the class slides). Some of you may complete these exercises in class, but, you do have until 11:59 pm the next calendar day (not the next class day) to complete it and sync it. Class Exercises will be graded as Submitted, Excused, or Not Submitted. If you miss a class, you will still need to finish the in-class exercise. There will be about 16 to 20 exercises in total - one excuse is allowed for the semester, with additional excuses at the discretion of the instructor.

## Examination

There will be one exam in the last class. The exam is hands-on, open book, open notes, open web exam. The exam will be about 100 minutes long. The exam will be based largely on the graded homework and in-class exercises done.

## Course Policies

- **Missed Classes**: Students are required to let me know if you are going to miss a class. Any student missing class is responsible for obtaining all material that may have been distributed on class days when he/she was absent.

- **Need for Academic Accommodation**: Babson College is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. Any student who may need accommodation(s) based on the impact of a disability should contact the Department of Accessibility Services (DAS)  as early in the semester as possible. Accessibility Services staff may be reached by email at accessibility@babson.edu, by phone at (781) 239-4075, or by visiting Hollister Hall, Suite 220. Accessibility Services staff will coordinate reasonable academic accommodations for eligible students.

- **Honor Code**: Integrity is a core institutional value at Babson. The Babson College Undergraduate Honor Code sets forth clear expectations with regard to how your behaviors, actions, and decision making support our institutional commitment to integrity. The Code, and all that it comprises, aims to build a Community of Honor at Babson - one that is connected and strengthened by each member’s individual commitment to integrity and ethical decision making in all that we do. As a Babson student, you are committing to being an active and engaged participant in our Community of Honor, in partnership with your fellow students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

- **Academic Integrity**:

  In this course, you are required to abide by the College’s Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures as outlined in [Babson’s Student Code of Ethics](https://www.babson.edu/media/babson/assets/community-standards/babson-code-of-ethics.pdf). Please review the College’s Student Code of Ethics in its entirety, as it is your responsibility to take the appropriate steps to ensure your understanding of the Code. Ignorance of the policies is not a valid excuse for any violations.

  Academic integrity is important for two reasons. First, independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most they can from their educational experience and the pursuit of knowledge. Second, academic misconduct violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and diminishes the achievements of the entire college community. Accordingly, Babson views academic misconduct as one of the most serious violations of the College’s expectations that a student can commit while at Babson College. Specific behaviors that constitute academic misconduct, as defined in the Code, are **cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism, participation in academically dishonest activities, and unauthorized collaboration.** In the instance I am presented with evidence to suggest that you engaged in any of these behaviors, I will refer the incident to the [Office of Community Standards](https://www.babson.edu/student-life/community-standards/) for review.  

  For your coursework, you are required to affirm your understanding of and commitment to the academic honesty and integrity expectations set forth in the Code. You may be asked to write the following pledge on every exam, paper, project, or other academic exercise:

      “I have abided by the Babson Code of Ethics in this work and pledge to be better than that which would compromise my integrity.” 

  If you have questions relative to academic integrity expectations within the context of a particular assignment, please ask me directly. General questions can be directed to communitystandards@babson.edu.  

* **Conflict Navigation Services**:
  
  Conflict – especially when working in groups – is a normal, healthy, and expected part of life and ideally is viewed as an opportunity to strengthen relationships, improve efficiency, and rectify underlying concerns that often otherwise go unaddressed. Resolving conflict is a vital part of the educational journey of the Babson student and entrepreneur and requires your active participation and skill development. If you experience interpersonal conflict in this course, I encourage you to explore the [College’s Conflict Navigation Services](https://bit.ly/babsonconflictform) as a resource.
