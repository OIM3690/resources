## Private Repository for the Course

The first task in this course will be to set up a private repository on GitHub for all web pages related to the class. The instructor will provide a demonstration of how to do this and guide you through the process at the beginning of the semester. The repository will initially consist of simple and basic web page(s), which will be developed and expanded throughout the course. Most course assignments, including in-class activities/exercises, quizzes, most graded homework, will be committed and pushed to this repository. This repository will serve as your personal website related to the class and will be kept private on GitHub. It is crucial that you frequently update this repository, as all the classwork will be evaluated based on the content and organization of the repository. Please note that this repository should not to be confused with the final project repository.


## In-Class Exercises

During most classes, we will complete several hands-on exercises, labeled as "ex_" on the class slides. While some students may finish these exercises during class, all students have until 11:59 PM the following calendar day to complete and push the exercise to Github. Class exercises will be graded as Finished, Partially Finished, Excused, or Not Submitted. If you miss a class, it is still required to complete the in-class exercise. There will be a total of approximately 16-20 exercises, with one excuse allowed for the semester, and additional excuses granted at the discretion of the instructor. It's important to note that while completing the exercises, you may seek help from others, including online sources, but it is essential that you understand what you have submitted, give references or links to the help you have used in the code comments and clearly credit the sources. Failure to do so would be considered a violation of Babson's Honor Code.

## Quizzes

Throughout the course, there will be multiple quizzes to assess student's understanding of the material covered. These quizzes will be in different formats: some will be taken through Canvas, while others will be in-class programming problems. Most quizzes will be announced beforehand. Each quiz will be worth 2 or 3 times the value of an exercise, depending on the level of difficulty and the number of problems. It is important to note that no make-up quizzes will be given, unless you have a valid medical excuse. Missing a quiz without a valid excuse will result in a grade of zero for that quiz. We encourage you to attend every class, and reach out to the instructor if you have any questions or concerns about a quiz.

## Graded Homework

Throughout the course, there will be a total of 3-4 graded homework assignments. Each assignment must be submitted by 11:59 PM on the due date specified in the accompanying instructions document. Late submissions will incur a deduction of 10 points per day or partial day, up to four days. Assignments submitted more than four days past the due date will receive a grade of zero. Extensions may be granted at the discretion of the instructor if requested in advance. Homework assignments are considered to be individual activities. If you need help, feel free to reach out to the instructor. Note: Your assignment repositories created under the [course GitHub organization](https://github.com/OIM3690) (not your peronsal private repository) may be modified or removed by the instructor after the semester ends. 

It's important to note that while completing the homework assignments, you may seek help from others, including online sources, but it is essential that you understand what you have submitted, give references or links to the help you have used in the code comments and clearly credit the sources. Failure to do so would be considered a violation of Babson's Honor Code. 

## Project

The term project for this course is an individual website development endeavor that entails the conceptualization, design, and implementation of a website. You are required to host your site on an advertising-free hosting service. You have the option to use a free cloud service or GitHub Pages to host your website. Deliverables for the project will be due periodically throughout the semester as outlined in the course schedule. While there will not be any class presentations of the projects, the instructor may ask specific students to showcase their projects, as it could add value to the class. Further information will be made available soon on Canvas/GitHub.

## ~~Examination~~

~~There will be one exam in the last class. The exam is hands-on, open book, open notes, open web exam. The exam will be about 100 minutes long. The exam will be based largely on the graded homework and in-class exercises done.~~

## Course Policies

- **Missed Classes**: It is mandatory for students to inform the instructor if they will be absent from a class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining all materials and information that were distributed or covered during the class they missed.

- **Need for Academic Accommodation**: Babson College is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. Any student who may need accommodation(s) based on the impact of a disability should contact the Department of Accessibility Services (DAS)  as early in the semester as possible. Accessibility Services staff may be reached by email at accessibility@babson.edu, by phone at (781) 239-4075, or by visiting Hollister Hall, Suite 220. Accessibility Services staff will coordinate reasonable academic accommodations for eligible students.

- **Honor Code**: Integrity is a core institutional value at Babson. The Babson College Undergraduate Honor Code sets forth clear expectations with regard to how your behaviors, actions, and decision making support our institutional commitment to integrity. The Code, and all that it comprises, aims to build a Community of Honor at Babson - one that is connected and strengthened by each member’s individual commitment to integrity and ethical decision making in all that we do. As a Babson student, you are committing to being an active and engaged participant in our Community of Honor, in partnership with your fellow students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

- **Academic Integrity**:

  In this course, you are required to abide by the College’s Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures as outlined in [Babson’s Student Code of Ethics](https://www.babson.edu/media/babson/assets/community-standards/babson-code-of-ethics.pdf). Please review the College’s Student Code of Ethics in its entirety, as it is your responsibility to take the appropriate steps to ensure your understanding of the Code. Ignorance of the policies is not a valid excuse for any violations.

  Academic integrity is important for two reasons. First, independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most they can from their educational experience and the pursuit of knowledge. Second, academic misconduct violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and diminishes the achievements of the entire college community. Accordingly, Babson views academic misconduct as one of the most serious violations of the College’s expectations that a student can commit while at Babson College. Specific behaviors that constitute academic misconduct, as defined in the Code, are **cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism, participation in academically dishonest activities, and unauthorized collaboration.** In the instance I am presented with evidence to suggest that you engaged in any of these behaviors, I will refer the incident to the [Office of Community Standards](https://www.babson.edu/student-life/community-standards/) for review.  

  For your coursework, you are required to affirm your understanding of and commitment to the academic honesty and integrity expectations set forth in the Code. You may be asked to write the following pledge on every exam, paper, project, or other academic exercise:

  > "I have abided by the Babson Code of Ethics in this work and pledge to be better than that which would compromise my integrity." 

  If you have questions relative to academic integrity expectations within the context of a particular assignment, please ask instructor directly. General questions can be directed to communitystandards@babson.edu.  

* **Conflict Navigation Services**:
  
  Conflict – especially when working in groups – is a normal, healthy, and expected part of life and ideally is viewed as an opportunity to strengthen relationships, improve efficiency, and rectify underlying concerns that often otherwise go unaddressed. Resolving conflict is a vital part of the educational journey of the Babson student and entrepreneur and requires your active participation and skill development. If you experience interpersonal conflict in this course, I encourage you to explore the [College’s Conflict Navigation Services](https://bit.ly/babsonconflictform) as a resource.
